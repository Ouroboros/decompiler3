# Coding Style Guide

## Rules

### -2. Read CLAUDE.md First
ALWAYS read CLAUDE.md before starting any task to refresh the rules.

### -1. Language Usage
- **User communication**: Chinese
- **Code, comments, commit messages, tool descriptions**: English

### -0.5. Git Commit Policy
NEVER auto-commit. Only create commits when explicitly requested by user.

### -0.25. Code Modification Policy
NEVER modify code during discussion. Only modify code AFTER user explicitly confirms the approach.

### 0. NEVER TOUCH binaryninja-api/
READ ONLY - no writes, edits, or deletes.

### 1. NO HARDCODED MAGIC NUMBERS
Use named constants: `offset // WORD_SIZE` not `offset // 4`
Common: `WORD_SIZE = 4` (in `ir/llil.py`)

### 2. Import at Module Top Level
Import at file top, not inside functions (except circular dependency with comment).

### 3. Comment Documentation
Reference constants in comments: `offset // WORD_SIZE` not `offset // 4`

### 4. Assignment Spacing
Always space around `=`: `x = 5`

### 5. Blank Lines Between Conditional Blocks
Add blank line between `if`/`elif`, `elif`/`elif`, `elif`/`else`, `if`/`else`.
```python
if cond1:
    action1()

elif cond2:
    action2()

else:
    action3()
```

### 6. English-Only Comments
No Chinese or other languages.

### 7. NO @staticmethod
Use `@classmethod` for inheritance support.

### 8. Concise Git Commit Messages
Short (1-2 sentences), no signatures/metadata.

### 9. Concise Comments
Keep comments brief and meaningful. Avoid redundant explanations.
- ✅ `# Skip self-assignment (var = var)`
- ❌ `# This code checks if the variable is equal to itself and if so we skip it`
- ✅ Use self-explanatory names instead of verbose comments
- ❌ Don't state the obvious: `x = 5  # Set x to 5`
